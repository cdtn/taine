### Notes

The project is named after Hippolyte Taine â€” a French historian, critic, and philosopher from the 19th century.
In his *Philosophie de l'art* book he considers an artwork not as a self-contained message, but rather as a representative of a bigger cluster of artist's creations characterized by his style.
That cluster, in turn, is a part of a bigger group of artworks sharing a common epoch and region. And further those groups are a part of human art history.
